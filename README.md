## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was a quick exercise with very simple features. The project brief didn't really require any additional knowledge, but I enjoyed working with CSS Flex properties. Declaring color variables in the CSS stylesheet helps ensure that the styling can be updated without having to change multiple lines of code.


### Continued development

Going forward, I was to strengthen my skills with React and may try to repeat this exercise with that.
